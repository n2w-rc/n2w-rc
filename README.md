About Me

i'm n2w-rc (you may call me Ota)
and i started learning software engineering in 2019 as an 8-year-old, but because of pandemic in 2020, that paused for two years before going back to where i was in 2022 (this year it's a bit safer to go outside, moved out of the usual location and went somewhere else), which now involved more stuff about low-level programming, specifically working on gnu/linux sys just for fun.
here, i just remained not so interactive with the internet because i'm shy. i then started learning more stuff about hardwares/electronics and science in 2023 because i learned a little too much and thought "i can work with these".

just so you know, i use nixos and arch btw.
