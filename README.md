About Me

I started learning software engineering in 2019 at eight years old. The pandemic paused that for 2020–2021, but I picked it back up in 2022. Right now, I’m into low-level programming and `tinkering` with GNU/Linux systems for fun. I'm not just interested in software development, I keep on learning hardwares/electronics, and science. It's a lot of work for someone who's active at school, but this might be worth it? Hopefully, yes.

### Operating systems I use:
- NixOS
- EndeavourOS
## Doing:
- Build and complete a compiler.
- Building an autonomous multi-LLM operator.
## Ongoing projects (all of them aren't published)
- ORCA (just a placeholder name) — autonomous multi-LLM operator that runs shell/browser/IDE/GUI workflows + universal GUI control, plugins in Lua/Python/Rust, can self-heal.
- Noni (also a placeholder name) — an architecture-specialized compiler built on top of Rust. Planned to inter-opt with Assembly.
## Projects that were deprecated:
p-zero — Rust based backend for Gentoo's Portage.
