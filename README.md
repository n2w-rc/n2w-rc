About Me

I started learning software engineering in 2019 at eight years old. The pandemic paused that for 2020–2021, but I picked it back up in 2022. Right now, I’m into low-level programming and `tinkering` with GNU/Linux systems for fun. I'm not just interested in software development, I keep on learning hardwares/electronics, and science. It's a lot of work for someone who's active at school, but this might be worth it? Hopefully, yes.

### Operating systems I use:
- NixOS
- Gentoo
