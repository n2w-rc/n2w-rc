About Me

I started learning programming in 2019 at just eight years old. But I stopped due to pandemic. (2020-2021, I think.) But I got back to this sort of hobby. I use NixOS because I can manage my stuff declaratively and such. Messing around with electronics is my style too, and then led me to learning more hardwares. I also became interested in science because of a great teacher. This might be an overwork for a student like me, and I'm not sure of it.

### Operating systems I use:
- NixOS
- Gentoo
